## 📊 What Was Wrong?

**The Problem:**
Your code had typos that didn't match the database:

| Code Said | Database Has | Fixed |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| `admin` table | `admins` table | ✅ |
| `anme` column | `aname` column | ✅ |

**The Error:**
```
java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'railway.admin' doesn't exist
```

**Why It Failed:**
- Code looked for table `admin` (singular)
- Database has table `admins` (plural)
- Also had typo `anme` instead of `aname`

---

## 🎯 Quick Test After Fix

**1. Stop Tomcat** (if running)
**2. Clean project in Eclipse**
**3. Start Tomcat**
**4. Try login** at: http://localhost:8080/Railway/Admin/AdminLogin.jsp

**If it works:** ✅ You should see the admin dashboard!

**If it still fails:** Check Eclipse Console for new errors and let me know.

- ✅ Fixed column name typo: `anme` → `aname`
