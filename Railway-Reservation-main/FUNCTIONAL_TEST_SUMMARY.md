## ⚠️ Pages Requiring Authentication (Expected Behavior)

These 8 pages correctly require login - **THIS IS GOOD SECURITY!**

### Admin-Only Pages (Require Admin Login)
1. ⚠️ Current Admins Management
2. ⚠️ Add Admin
3. ⚠️ Current Users Management
4. ⚠️ Add User
5. ⚠️ Current Trains Management
6. ⚠️ Add Train
7. ⚠️ Trains Info Page

### User-Only Pages (Require User Login)
8. ⚠️ My Reservations

**Note:** These "failures" are actually **correct security behavior**. Pages are protected and redirect to login when accessed without authentication.
